   libssh2_keepalive_send()
 o Added libssh2_knownhost_addc(), libssh2_init() and libssh2_exit()
 o Added LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_IS***() macros

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o fix memory leak in libssh2_session_startup()
 o added missing error codes - shown as hangs in blocking mode
 o fix memory leak in userauth_keyboard_interactive()
 o libssh2_knownhost_del: fix write to freed memory

 o avoid using poll on interix and mac os x systems
 o fix scp memory leak
 o Correctly clear blocking flag after sending multipart packet
 o Reduce used window sizes by factor 10
 o libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex() handles a NULL password
 o sftp_init() deal with _libssh2_channel_write() short returns

 o Use poll instead of select when available.  By Paul Querna.

 o Add APIs to have libssh2 automatically send keep-alive requests.
   The APIs are libssh2_keepalive_config, and libssh2_keepalive_send.
   By Simon Josefsson.

 o Add global init/exit points, to do crypto initialization in one place.
   The APIs are libssh2_init and libssh2_exit.  By Lars Nordin.

* (February 15 2010) Daniel Stenberg:
- Added 46 new man pages for public convenience macros. The man pages  are
  just short redirects to the actual underlying function. The were all
  initially created by a script.

- Committed the patch by Yoichi Iwaki in bug #2929647, which fixed a memory
  leak when an 'outbuf' was still allocated when a session was freed.

Version 1.2.4 (February 13, 2010)

 o Resolve compile issues on Solaris x64 and UltraSPARC
 o Allow compiling with OpenSSL when AES isn't available
 o Fix Tru64 socklen_t compile issue with example/direct_tcpip.c

Version 1.2.3 (February 3, 2010)

 o Added libssh2_trace_sethandler()
 o Added the direct_tcpip.c example
 o Fixed memory leak in userauth_publickey
 o Added support for authentication via SSH-Agent.  By Daiki Ueno.

 o Respond to unknown SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST/SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
   with SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE/SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE in order to
   make (at least) OpenSSH server keepalive work.  Before OpenSSH
   servers (configured with a positive ClientAliveInterval) would
   terminate connections against libssh2 clients because libssh2 did
   not respond properly to the request.  By Simon Josefsson.

Version 1.2.2 (November 16, 2009)

* This release includes the following changes:

  o Fix crash when server sends an invalid SSH_MSG_IGNORE message.
    Reported by Bob Alexander <balexander@expressor-software.com> in
    <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.network.ssh.libssh2.devel/2530>.
    By Simon Josefsson.

  o Support for the "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr" ciphers
    as per RFC 4344 for libgcrypt and OpenSSL.  They are now the
    preferred ciphers.  By Simon Josefsson.

  o Support for the "arcfour128" cipher as per RFC 4345 for libgcrypt
    and OpenSSL.  It is preferred over the normal "arcfour" cipher
    which is somewhat broken.  By Simon Josefsson.

  o Add support for GCC visibility features.  By Cristian Rodríguez.

  o Fix libssh2_channel_forward_accept.  By Juzna.

  o Generate Win32 files correctly.   By Peter Stuge.

  o Fix permission issue in ssh2 self test.  By Dan Fandrich.

  o Use memmove instead of memcpy in one place which copies
    overlapping memory areas.

  o Cleanup hard coding of cipher modes in libgcrypt backend.  By Simon.

  o Added man page for libssh2_knownhost_free.  By Daniel.

Version 1.2.1 (September 28, 2009)

* This release includes the following changes:

  o generate and install libssh2.pc

  ... and the following bugfixes:

  o proper return codes returned from several functions
  o return EAGAIN internal cleanup
  o added knownhost.c to windows makefiles
  o pass private-key to OpenSSL as a filename with BIO_new_file().
  o make libssh2_scp_send/recv do blocking mode correctly
  o libssh2_channel_wait_closed() could hang
  o libssh2_channel_read_ex() must return 0 when closed
  o added gettimeofday() function for win32 for the debug trace outputs
  o transport layer bug causing invalid -39 (LIBSSH2_ERROR_BAD_USE) errors
  o scp examples now loop correctly over libssh2_channel_write()

* (August 29 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

 - I fixed all code to use the recently added dedicated linked list functions
   instead of doing the same stuff spread out all over.

 - I also fixed a few cases where local variables where used to keep memory
   but was used to keep state for re-invokes due to non-blocking situations
   which would lead to segfaults.

Version 1.2 (August 10, 2009)
-----------------------------

* (August 02 2009) Alexander Lamaison:

 - changed _libssh2_rsa_new_private and _libssh2_rsa_new_private so that they
   no longer use the OpenSSL functions that take a FILE* argument.  Passing
   CRT-created objects across a DLL boundary causes crashes on Windows of the
   DLL and the client aren't linked to the exact same verison of the CRT. Now
   we pass the keys as strings to avoid this issue.

* (May 29 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

 - Updated the knownhost API and there are now 9 functions, and all of them
   have man pages. The libssh2.h now defines HAVE_LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_API to
   ease things for applications to check for the correct release before trying
   to use it.

* (May 23 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

 - Anonymous bug report #2795816 revealed that doing subsequent
   libssh2_sftp_init() calls on the same session failed.

* (May 20 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  - made libssh2_sftp_write() properly deal with huge/any sized input buffers.

  - fixed libssh2_channel_write_ex() to return the correct return code, and
    deal with sending off huge buffers better

* (May 7 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  - linked list code. I got a bit tired of the fact that we don't have any
    generic linked-list functions within libssh2 so I wrote up the first embryo
    for one that I use for this new functionality. The plan would then be to
    move all existing code that uses linked lists to use this new set.

  - base64 encode. I had to add a base64 encoding function which was missing
    in the code base so it helps to "bloat" my patch.

  - The knownhost API is currently:

    _init() - init a bundle of known hosts
    _add()  - add a known host
    _del()  - delete a known host
    _free() - free an entire bundle of known hosts
    _check() - check if a host+key is present in the bundle

    The convenience function:

    _parsefile() - reads a ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and add all entries to the
                   given bundle

   - there's no docs other than some comments in the code/headers yet

  - the patch includes changes to example/simple/ssh2_exec.c that makes use of
    a few of these functions. Using that I've verified that the functions in
    fact can verify my localhost's key agains my ~/.ssh/known_hosts file

* (Apr 30 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  Markus posted a bug report about a bad 0-return from libssh2_channel_read:
  http://libssh2.haxx.se/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2009-04/0076.shtml

  And it was indeed a bad loop that terminated too early due to a receveived
  close packet.

* (Apr 14 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  libssh2_poll() and libssh2_poll_channel_read() are now considered and
  documented deprecated and they will be removed at next soname bump. It also
  saves us from fixing some rather quirky bugs in libssh2_poll()...


Version 1.1 (April 2, 2009)
---------------------------

- (Mar 28 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  Jean-Louis Charton found a memory leak in
  libssh2_userauth_hostbased_fromfile_ex()

- (Mar 25 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

   * Renamed the functions in src/transport.c to be _libssh2_transport_ prefixed
     and introduced a transport.h header.

   * Fixed the blocking mode to only change behavior not the actual underlying
     socket mode so we now always work with non-blocking sockets. This also
     introduces a new rule of thumb in libssh2 code: we don't call the
     external function calls internally. We use the internal (non-blocking)
     ones!

   * libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust2 was added and
     libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust is now deprecated

   * Introduced "local" header files with prototypes etc for different parts
     instead of cramming everything into libssh2_priv.h. channel.h is the
     first.

- (Mar 19 2009) Daniel Stenberg: based on a patch by "E L" we now use errno
  properly after recv() and send() calls (that internally are now known as
  _libssh2_recv() and _libssh2_send()) so that the API and more works fine on
  windows too!

- (Mar 17 2009) Simon Josefsson:

  Added a Libtool -export-symbols-regex flag to reduce the number of
  exported symbols in shared libraries.  Reported by Mikhail Gusarov.

- (Mar 16 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  I renamed a few man pages to match the exact name of the functions they
  describe. I also added template versions for the 13 functions that
  previously lacked man pages. While these don't contain any docs just yet, it
  will now be easier to add the info as the foundation is there!

- (Mar 15 2009) Daniel Stenberg:

  * libssh2_channel_read_ex() was simplified and enhanced. It now adjusts the
    window less frequent and uses much larger window that now allows MUCH
    faster transfers.

  * SCP send/recv now allow file names with whitespaces etc, thanks to a patch
    by Heiner Steven

- (Mar 13 2009) Daniel Stenberg: Cleanups, that do seem to have boosted SFTP
  download performance up to 300% in some tests:

  * cut off "_ex" from several internal function names

  * corrected some log outputs

  * simplified libssh2_channel_read_ex() and made it much faster in the process

  * cut out {{{ and }}} comments that were incorrect anyway

  * fixed sftp_packet_ask() to return the correct packet by using memcmp() and
    not strncmp()

  * fixed mkdir()'s wait for packet to use the correct request_id - it
    semi-worked previously because strncmp() in sftp_packet_ask() made it
    match far too easily.

  * took away the polling functionality from sftp_packet_ask() since it wasn't
    used

- (Mar 7 2009) Olivier Hervieu pointed out a flaw in the
  libssh2_channel_x11_req_ex() function that made it produce a crappy random
  chunk of data. Peter Stuge improved the fix to not do out-of-boundary
  writes. I (Daniel Stenberg) replaced the snprintf() with a plain sprintf()
  since the size argument wasn't adding anything anyway.

- (Feb 23 2009) Added libssh2_version()

- (Feb 20 2009) libssh2_channel_direct_tcpip_ex() bug #1902169 fixed, which
  caused it to fail when called a second time.

- (Feb 12 2009) Romain Bondue extended Markus Moeller fix from Feb 8, based on
  a previous (uncommitted) patch by Erik Brossler. It improves
  libssh2_channel_write_ex in blocking situations when the socket is set non-
  blocking.

- (Feb 8 2009) Markus Moeller fixed a flaw in libssh2_channel_write_ex() that
  would occur on EAGAIN situations.

Version 1.0 (December 26 2008)
------------------------------

- (Dec 20 2008) Based on Alexander Lamaison's patch, there's now a new
  function called libssh2_sftp_tell64() that returns the 64 bit file offset,
  as the existing libssh2_sftp_tell() only returns a size_t.

- (Dec 18 2008) Markus Moeller fixed the issue also reported by Alexander
  Lamaison which caused SFTP reads with large buffers to fail.

- Several flaws were fixed that prevented at least SFTP to work reliably

- Vlad Grachov brought the new function called
  libssh2_session_block_directions() which returns a bitmask for what
  directions the connection blocks. It is to be used applications that use
  non-blocking sockets and when a libssh2 function returns
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN this function can be used to figure out in which
  direction the socket would block and thus it can wait for the socket to
  again be ready for communication in that direction before it calls libssh2
  again.

- Vincent Jaulin brought the new libssh2_channel_request_pty_size_ex()
  function.

- Carlo Bramini fixed the build for msys+mingw. Bug #1943976.

- Neil Gierman provided improved Visual Studio 2008 code in bug #1946268

- Bug #1862727 fixed libssh2_poll() to work on windows (by defining
  HAVE_SELECT).

- Based on bug #1815692, we introduce libssh2_sftp_seek64() that allows
  seeking beyond the 2GB margin even on 32bit machines.

- Based on a patch in bug #1878059 by Steven Ayre libssh2 now parses >2GB file
  sizes when downloading SCP files.

- Bug #2064371 pointed out that the SSH2 banner may not use dash
  ('-'). Reported by Bjorn Stenborg.

- Sean Peterson fixed a key re-exchange bug:
  http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/libssh2/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2008-06/0002.shtml

- Mike Protts filed the bug report #1908724 that identified and fixed a problem
  with SFTP stat on files >4GB in size. Previously it used 32bit math only.

- Removed a stderr debug message that was accidentally left in (bug #1863153)

- OpenSSL and libz detection changed to make cross-compiling to Mingw
  work.  See README for parameters to use if the auto-detection does
  not work for you.  From Simon Josefsson.

- Simon Josefsson added a self-test that uses libssh2 to connect to a
  local sshd (only enabled if if OpenSSH is installed).

Version 0.18 (November 11 2007)
-------------------------------

- Various changes that improve non-blocking operations and prevent stalls.
  Especially noticable on Windows since libssh2 just didn't work properly
  non-blocking on Windows before.

- Peter O'Gorman reported how a SCP transfer would hang for him, and it was
  fairly easy reproducable. One bug was in the transport layer, ignoring to
  read more data while there was data left even though it couldn't decrypt the
  data that was left due to it being too little... The other bug was in the
  channel layer, where the libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust() function
  missed to set the state variables at times and thus this function would
  misbehave on repeated invokes.

- Changed the signature of libssh2_channel_setenv_ex to add const to the
  "varname" parameter (Dan Fandrich)

- Satish Mittal and David J Sullivan fixed an infinit recv() loop in
  libssh2_banner_receive()

   some poking. (Sorry if I forgot anyone I should've mentioned here.)

Of course we would have nothing without the great work by Sara Golemon that
we're extending and building upon.

Version 0.15 (June 15 2007)

-----------

  Fix potential segfault in compression/decompression.

  Fix compatability with older versions of OpenSSL

  Swapped order of none,zlib compression modes to prefer no compression by
  default.

  Added sys/uio.h for platforms (FBSD) which need it in order to define struct

  libssh2_session_method_pref() style

  Fixed libssh2_attr2bin() (effects any setstat style call).

  Fixed authenticating with encrypted private key.

  Fixed authenticating via ssh-dss public key.

  Fixed KEX_INIT cookie and packet padding to use actual random data

  Added DESTDIR support to makefiles (Adam Go³êbiowski -- I hope that
  character set translates right)

  Added libssh2_channel_forward_listen_ex(), libssh2_channel_forward_cancel(),
  and libssh2_channel_forward_accept().

  Added ./configure option '--disable-gex-new' to allow using the older
  group-exchange format

  Added MAC methods hmac-md5 and hmac-md5-96.

Version 0.4
-----------

  Fixed crash when trying to free sftp_dirhandle data from a filehandle struct.

  Added libssh2_banner_set(), specify an arbitrary banner to send on introduction.

Version 0.3
-----------

  Fixed libssh2_channel_read_ex().  Packet loop initialized BEFORE transport polled for new packets (should have been after).

  Fixed blocking issues in scp_send()/scp_recv().

  Fixed degree of indirection in macerror callback.

  Changed packet read mechanism to use a fixed buffer and avoid unnecessary alloc/free calls. (especially while non-block looping)

  Added channel close callback.

  Added SFTP support (Using its own header file: libssh2_sftp.h)

Version 0.2
-----------

  Changed extended data ignorance mechanism:
    libssh2_channel_ignore_extended_data() changed to libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data()
    Macro introduced for backward compatability during beta phase.
    *** THE LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_IGNORE_EXTENDED_DATA() MACRO WILL BE REMOVED PRIOR TO 1.0 RELEASE ***
    libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data() may be passed one of three "ignore_mode" constants
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_NONE       Default behavior, queue ED packets and return them with read_ex
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_IGNORE     Equivalent to libssh2_channel_ignore_extended_data()
                                               IGNORE will implicitly flush the extended data stream(s)
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MERGE      Calls to channel_read() will check both the standard data stream
                                               and the extended data stream(s) for the first available packet

  Changed libssh2_session_disconnect_ex() to return an error code when alloc fails

  Added libssh2_channel_flush_ex() and basic macros: ..._flush() ..._flush_stderr()
