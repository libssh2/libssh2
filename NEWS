Version 1.0 ( )
-------------------------------

- (Dec 20 2008) Based on Alexander Lamaison's patch, there's now a new
  function called libssh2_sftp_tell64() that returns the 64 bit file offset,
  as the existing libssh2_sftp_tell() only returns a size_t.

- (Dec 18 2008) Markus Moeller fixed the issue also reported by Alexander
  Lamaison which caused SFTP reads with large buffers to fail.

- Several flaws were fixed that prevented at least SFTP to work reliably

- Vlad Grachov brought the new function called
  libssh2_session_block_directions() which returns a bitmask for what
  directions the connection blocks. It is to be used applications that use
  non-blocking sockets and when a libssh2 function returns
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN this function can be used to figure out in which
  direction the socket would block and thus it can wait for the socket to
  again be ready for communication in that direction before it calls libssh2
  again.

- Vincent Jaulin brought the new libssh2_channel_request_pty_size_ex()
  function.

- Carlo Bramini fixed the build for msys+mingw. Bug #1943976.

- Neil Gierman provided improved Visual Studio 2008 code in bug #1946268

- Bug #1862727 fixed libssh2_poll() to work on windows (by defining
  HAVE_SELECT).

- Based on bug #1815692, we introduce libssh2_sftp_seek64() that allows
  seeking beyond the 2GB margin even on 32bit machines.

- Based on a patch in bug #1878059 by Steven Ayre libssh2 now parses >2GB file
  sizes when downloading SCP files.

- Bug #2064371 pointed out that the SSH2 banner may not use dash
  ('-'). Reported by Bjorn Stenborg.

- Sean Peterson fixed a key re-exchange bug:
  http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/libssh2/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2008-06/0002.shtml

- Mike Protts filed the bug report #1908724 that identified and fixed a problem
  with SFTP stat on files >4GB in size. Previously it used 32bit math only.

- Removed a stderr debug message that was accidentally left in (bug #1863153)

- OpenSSL and libz detection changed to make cross-compiling to Mingw
  work.  See README for parameters to use if the auto-detection does
  not work for you.  From Simon Josefsson.

- Simon Josefsson added a self-test that uses libssh2 to connect to a
  local sshd (only enabled if if OpenSSH is installed).

Version 0.18 (November 11 2007)
-------------------------------

- Various changes that improve non-blocking operations and prevent stalls.
  Especially noticable on Windows since libssh2 just didn't work properly
  non-blocking on Windows before.

- Peter O'Gorman reported how a SCP transfer would hang for him, and it was
  fairly easy reproducable. One bug was in the transport layer, ignoring to
  read more data while there was data left even though it couldn't decrypt the
  data that was left due to it being too little... The other bug was in the
  channel layer, where the libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust() function
  missed to set the state variables at times and thus this function would
  misbehave on repeated invokes.

- Changed the signature of libssh2_channel_setenv_ex to add const to the
  "varname" parameter (Dan Fandrich)

- Satish Mittal and David J Sullivan fixed an infinit recv() loop in
  libssh2_banner_receive()

This release would not have been possible without these friendly contributors:

   some poking. (Sorry if I forgot anyone I should've mentioned here.)

Of course we would have nothing without the great work by Sara Golemon that 
we're extending and building upon.

  libssh2_session_method_pref() style

  Fixed libssh2_attr2bin() (effects any setstat style call).

  Fixed KEX_INIT cookie and packet padding to use actual random data

  Added DESTDIR support to makefiles (Adam Go³êbiowski -- I hope that
  character set translates right)

  Added libssh2_channel_forward_listen_ex(), libssh2_channel_forward_cancel(),
  and libssh2_channel_forward_accept().

  Added ./configure option '--disable-gex-new' to allow using the older
  group-exchange format

Version 0.2
-----------

  Changed extended data ignorance mechanism:
    libssh2_channel_ignore_extended_data() changed to libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data()
    Macro introduced for backward compatability during beta phase.
    *** THE LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_IGNORE_EXTENDED_DATA() MACRO WILL BE REMOVED PRIOR TO 1.0 RELEASE ***
    libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data() may be passed one of three "ignore_mode" constants
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_NONE       Default behavior, queue ED packets and return them with read_ex
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_IGNORE     Equivalent to libssh2_channel_ignore_extended_data()
                                               IGNORE will implicitly flush the extended data stream(s)
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MERGE      Calls to channel_read() will check both the standard data stream
                                               and the extended data stream(s) for the first available packet

  Changed libssh2_session_disconnect_ex() to return an error code when alloc fails

  Added libssh2_channel_flush_ex() and basic macros: ..._flush() ..._flush_stderr()
    flush_ex accepts either the streamid (0 for standard data, 1 for stderr) or one of the two following constants:
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_ALL                Flush all streams
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_EXTENDED_DATA      Flush all streams EXCEPT the standard data stream

  Added libssh2_session_callback_set() for setting ignore/debug/disconnect/macerror callbacks

  Added libssh2_session_method_pref() to selectively set methods and method preferences.

  Added libssh2_session_methods() to determine what methods were negotiated.
