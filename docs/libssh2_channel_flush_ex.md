# DESCRIPTION

*channel* - Active channel stream to flush.

*streamid* - Specific substream number to flush. Groups of substreams may
be flushed by passing on of the following Constants.
.br
**LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_EXTENDED_DATA**: Flush all extended data substreams
.br
**LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_ALL**: Flush all substreams

Flush the read buffer for a given channel instance. Individual substreams may
be flushed by number or using one of the provided macros.

# RETURN VALUE

Return the number of bytes flushed or negative on failure.
It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it is not really a failure per se.
