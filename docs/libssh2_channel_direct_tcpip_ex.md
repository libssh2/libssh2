# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <libssh2.h>

LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *
libssh2_channel_direct_tcpip_ex(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session,
                                const char *host, int port,
                                const char *shost, int sport);

LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *
libssh2_channel_direct_tcpip(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session,
