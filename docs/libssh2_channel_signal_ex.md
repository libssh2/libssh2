# DESCRIPTION

A signal can be delivered to the remote process/service. Some servers or
systems may not implement signals, in which case they will probably ignore this
message.

*channel* - Previously opened channel instance such as returned by

*signame* - The signal name is the same as the signal name constant, without the leading "SIG".

*signame_len* - Length of passed signal name parameter.

There is also a macro *libssh2_channel_signal(channel, signame)* that supplies the strlen of the signame.

# RETURN VALUE

Normal channel error codes.
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would block.
