# NAME

libssh2_channel_free - free all resources associated with a channel

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <libssh2.h>

int
libssh2_channel_free(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

*channel* - Channel stream to free.

Release all resources associated with a channel stream. If the channel has
not yet been closed with,
it will be called automatically so that the remote end may know that it
can safely free its own resources.

# RETURN VALUE

Return 0 on success or negative on failure. It returns
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it is not really a failure per se.
