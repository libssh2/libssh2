# DESCRIPTION

*session* - Session instance as returned by

*channel_type* - Channel type to open. Typically one of session,
direct-tcpip, or tcpip-forward. The SSH2 protocol allowed for additional
types including local, custom channel types.

*channel_type_len* - Length of channel_type

*window_size* - Maximum amount of unacknowledged data remote host is
allowed to send before receiving an SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST packet.

*packet_size* - Maximum number of bytes remote host is allowed to send
in a single SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA or SSG_MSG_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA packet.

*message* - Additional data as required by the selected channel_type.

*message_len* - Length of message parameter.

Allocate a new channel for exchanging data with the server. This method is
typically called through its macroized form:
or via
or

# RETURN VALUE

Pointer to a newly allocated LIBSSH2_CHANNEL instance, or NULL on errors.

# ERRORS

*LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC* - An internal memory allocation call failed.

*LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND* - Unable to send data on socket.

*LIBSSH2_ERROR_CHANNEL_FAILURE* -

*LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN* - Marked for non-blocking I/O but the call would block.
