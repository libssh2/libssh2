# NAME

libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data2 - set extended data handling mode

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <libssh2.h>

int
libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data2(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel,

# DESCRIPTION

*channel* - Active channel stream to change extended data handling on.

*ignore_mode* - One of the three LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_* Constants.

**LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_NORMAL**: Queue extended data for eventual
reading

**LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MERGE**: Treat extended data and ordinary
data the same. Merge all substreams such that calls to
will pull from all substreams on a first-in/first-out basis.

**LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_IGNORE**: Discard all extended data as it
arrives.

Change how a channel deals with extended data packets. By default all
extended data is queued until read by

# RETURN VALUE

Return 0 on success or LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block.
